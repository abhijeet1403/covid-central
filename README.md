# Pandemic central
Centralized repository for the source code of the platform which will enable decentralized but targetted pandemic relief efforts.

## Why?
To end pandemic in a country, the entire country and its different systems & subsystems need to exert concentrated efforts in combating the pandemic. This repository is a quest in building one platform which connects all the different real world entities playing role in this fight with automation, optimization and visualization.
